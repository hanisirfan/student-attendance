# Background
During the Covid-19 pandemic, our college have created a website to record student's attendance.

I noticed that if a class code doesn't exist, which consist of the course code + program code (ex: 1DipIT).

I also noticed that I could just send a POST request to the website submission endpoint to add my attendance record using Python (no CSRF protection).

This project is just a more friendly version of that Python code I created. I used it for a couple of my class attendance for testing purposes only! I do attend the class. This project is created just for fun. Do not use it for cheating!

# How To Use

Again, this project is just for fun and created to be used for cheating. But if you want to test it on your personal project, the how to use guide can be seen if you load the index.html file on the browser.
